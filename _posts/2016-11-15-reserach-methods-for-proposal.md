## RESEARCH METHODS

The principal method of analysis will be to develop energy systems models to examine the
allocation of power across renewable and non-renewable generating sources, and between jurisdictions
along interties. Our focus is on Canada and our approach will be to construct a decision support model
for two separate electricity grids, each representing a different mix of generating facilities. The grids are
connected by a transmission intertie that allows them to trade electricity and meet the constraints
imposed by different forms of generation. (Decision variables include the allocation of generation to the
various generators in the system, plus the capacities of transmission lines.) One grid relies primarily on
hydroelectricity, with remaining load met by natural gas and other power sources (including biomass).
The other system meets base-load power needs with coal, CCGT and/or biomass assets, while marginal
power is produced by a mix of hydro and open-cycle natural gas for peak power production. A
renewable source such as wind is introduced at various levels. Case studies will consider British
Columbia and Alberta, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador (NL); in both situations, one
grid is fossil fuel driven while the ‘partner’ grid consists almost exclusively of hydro assets, while new
interties are either under construction (NS-NL) or contemplated (BC-AB).
The energy systems models employ mathematical programming and simulation. A description of
the type of models that will be used in the study is found in van Kooten (2012). The models to be
developed in the proposed research will expand extensively on this prototype modeling to include the
integration of two grids in a more explicit fashion, a sub-model detailing the operation of hydroelectric
facilities, the interaction between disparate grid operators, and the calibration procedures.
Game Theory and Grid Expansion
The system operators will be modeled as strategic agents maximizing net revenues. Each
operator takes into account the decisions of the other operator via the reaction functions of game theory
(Bierman & Fernandez 1998). If the available data consist of hourly prices, the operators will maximize
profits with the net revenue function taking into account the decisions of the other operator through a
Bertrand game type of reaction function; alternatively, if hourly demand data are only available, this will
necessitate the use of cost minimization and a Cournot reaction function to model strategic decisions.
A challenge to energy systems modeling in this context concerns the use of game theory in
modeling the costs and benefits available when, in our study, two separate grid operators (or two
provincial governments) cooperate to allocate generating assets optimally to their mutual benefit. This
issue has not previously been considered in the modeling of large-scale transmission interties across
multiple grids and jurisdictions (e.g., see DeCarolis & Keith 2006). Addressing this issue and
determining how cooperative versus non-cooperative solutions affect the economic wellbeing and CO2
flux from electricity production and storage is one of the long-term objectives of the research.
Optimization is subject to technical constraints that are specific to each electricity grid. Accurate
specification of the constraints is important for measuring the true impact of renewable energy on the
generation assets, the overall grid and CO2 emissions. Thus, data collection will be a major component
of the project. We will employ an optimization approach (Ravindran et al. 2006) that builds upon
methods used previously (Prescott et al. 2007; Benitez et al. 2008; Maddaloni et al. 2008a, 2008b;
Prescott & van Kooten 2009; Timilsina et al 2013; Sopinka et al. 2013).
