Last month, I taught a lab about how to do optimization in R using ROI.

I also would likt to introduce JUMP in Julia which is taught in MIT optimization course.

I am surprised that [OMPR](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) acctually combinds ROI and JUMP.

> OMPR (Optimization Modelling Package) is a DSL to model and solve Mixed Integer Linear Programs. It is inspired by the excellent Jump project in Julia.


And I knew this from a great blog [Yet Another Math Programming Consultant](http://yetanothermathprogrammingconsultant.blogspot.ca/search?updated-max=2016-09-07T12:43:00-04:00&max-results=10&start=26&by-date=false) in Amsterdam. 

[Erwin Kalvelagen](https://plus.google.com/100547539949080099832) practices optimization in R, GAMS, and Julia. 

It is worth reading his blog.
